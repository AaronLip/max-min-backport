# max-min-backport
Backports the min and max dice modifiers from FoundryVTT 0.8.x

## Installation
Move this folder into your `data/modules` folder for FoundryVTT, then enable the module using the "Manage Modules" menu.

## Usage
Add `maxN` or `minN` to the end of a roll to limit the value of the roll. For example, `d10max4` will roll a die that will be between one and three 30% of the time, or four 70% of the time.
